## Installation - Local Development Guideline
### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & Docker Compose
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) (v16 or newer), npm and yarn
- [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation).  Any version above 6.0 works fine

### Setup Local Development Environment
1. Clone the project to local machine and go to the folder:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vinhngo1907/mern-v-social-media.git
    cd mern-v-social-media
```

2. Open `packages/server/.env` and adjust the `MONGODB_URI` to your MongoDB server name (localhost normally works if you're running locally).
  * [x] You can refernce in file ```packages/server/.env.default```

3. CD `packages/client` && Run `npm run start` to start the frontend client
  * [x] Wait for the build process to complete
  * [x] Navigate to http://localhost:5002 in your browser to explore the app

4. CD `packages/server` && Run `npm run server` to start the api server
‚òû Go to http://localhost:5001 in your browser to explore the server

5. CD `packages/cms` && Run `npm run server` to start the frontend cms
  * [x] Wait for the build process to complete
  * [x] Navigate to http://localhost:5003 in your browser to explore the app

## Build the app
**1. Build server (API)**
```
  cd packages/server
  npm install
  npm run server
```

**2. Build Client (B2C - V Social Community)**
```
  cd packages/client
  npm install
  npm run build
```
The build folder is created at: packages/client/build

**3. Build CMS (B2B - V Social Business)**
```
  cd packages/client
  npm install
  npm run build
```
The build folder is created at: packages/cms/build

## Deployment Guideline
### Prerequisites
- Render
- Netlify
- Permission to access resources in [mern-v-social-media](https://github.com/vinhngo1907/mern-v-social-media) project
- Credentials of __*****__ Statging MongoDB - ***The staging environment uses MongoDB Atlas (MongoDB Cloud) to simplify database management and scaling via a hosted cluster***.

### Deployment Steps
**1. Deploy Server in [Render](https://render.com/)**
1. Create an account and connect GitHub repo.

2. Create Web Service on Render.

3. Configuration:
  - Build Command: ```npm install```
  - Start Command: ```npm start``` or ```npm run server```
  - Environment Variables: enter environment variables (MONGODB_URI, PORT, etc.).

4. Render will automatically build and deploy when there is an update from GitHub.

**2. Deploy Client & CMS l√™n [Netlify](https://netlify.com/)**
1. Go to Netlify and select "Import from GitHub".
2. Select the repo, configure:
  - Build command: `npm run build`
  - Publish directory:
      * `client/build` (for user app)
      * `cms/build` (for CMS admin)
3. Netlify will automatically build and deploy.

# What can be improved
1. More unit tests for back-end(server).
2. Write some end-to-end tests.
3. Real-time sync for Chat Service using socket.io combine with message queue(RabbitMQ or Kafka).
4. The front-end(client - cms) can be built & deployed to Google Storage for faster performance.
5. We can create 1 more branch called releases. The CI should support deploying the app when code is merged to this branch.
