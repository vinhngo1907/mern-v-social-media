## Installation
### To run the app with Node.js and MongoDB

Install and start MongoDB (https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation).

Install Node.js (http://nodejs.org). Any version above 6.0 works fine

Open .env and adjust the `MONGODB_URI` to your MongoDB server name (localhost normally works if you're running locally).

1. Run `npm install`.

2. CD client && Run `npm run start` to start the frontend client
  * [x] Wait for the build process to complete

  * [x] Navigate to http://localhost:5002 in your browser to explore the app

3. CD Server && Run `npm run server` to start the api server

‚òû Go to http://localhost:5001 in your browser to explore the server

## Build the app
* Build manually
```
 $ npm start
```

After building the app, frontend and backend servers will be merged into a single server and be available at http://localhost:5002
