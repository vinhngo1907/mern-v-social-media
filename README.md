### To run the app with Node.js and MongoDB

Install and start MongoDB (https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation).

Install Node.js (http://nodejs.org). Any version above 6.0 works fine

Open .env and adjust the `MONGODB_URI` to your MongoDB server name (localhost normally works if you're running locally).

1. Run `npm install`.

2. CD client && Run `npm run start` to start the frontend server
